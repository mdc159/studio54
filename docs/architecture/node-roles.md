# 1215-VPS Node Roles

This document defines the role of each node type in the broader system.

`node-roles.md` defines the optimization goal and governance posture of each
node type. For how shared core, role overlays, and per-node manifests are laid
out in the repo, see [current-state.md](current-state.md) (actual layout) and
[north-star.md](north-star.md) (target layout). (The earlier
`deployment-model.md` has been superseded and was removed in the Phase 0 trim.)

The purpose is to keep the architecture from collapsing into "every machine does
everything." Different nodes are allowed to optimize for different things:

- the VPS hub optimizes for stability, continuity, and shared services
- the local prototype optimizes for proving the node pattern safely
- the engineering node optimizes for applied build and execution work
- the research node optimizes for exploration and autonomous experimentation

## Node Types

| Node | Primary job | Risk posture | May promote directly? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VPS hub` | Shared continuity and operational backbone | Conservative | No |
| `Linux prototype` | First implementation of the local-node pattern | Moderate | No |
| `Engineering node` | Applied engineering execution and tooling | Moderate | No |
| `Research / experimental node` | Autonomous search, exploration, and candidate generation | High | No |

The last column is intentional. Nodes may generate candidates, but promotion
into shared live behavior must flow through the promotion gate.

## Node types vs role overlays

Keep these concepts separate:

- node type: what a machine is for and how risky its behavior may be
- role overlay: which capability groups are enabled on that machine

Example:

- a VPS node type may enable `core`, `vps`, and optional `tools`
- an engineering node type may enable `core`, `media-gpu`, and optional `tools`

That separation is what lets one repo support multiple nodes without
branch-per-machine drift.

## 1. VPS Hub

The VPS hub is the canonical shared system.

It owns:

- continuity plane
- shared broker events
- shared artifact registry
- workflow nervous system
- observability and lineage
- shared memory integration
- promotion records

It should optimize for:

- uptime
- auditability
- replay correctness
- controlled exposure
- predictable operations

It should not be the primary place for:

- aggressive autonomous mutation
- unconstrained prompt experimentation
- high-churn eval loops

### Allowed behavior

- register candidate artifacts
- store evaluation records
- host promotion decisions
- run bounded evaluation jobs if needed

### Forbidden default behavior

- direct self-modification of live runtime behavior
- unreviewed production mutation from learning jobs
- direct peer-mesh control behavior across nodes

## 2. Linux Prototype Node

The Linux prototype node is the first concrete implementation of the local-node
pattern.

It exists to prove:

- the local substrate layout
- Hermes boundary behavior
- replay and outbox assumptions
- learning-plane integration
- candidate evaluation and rollback mechanics

It should be the first place new node-level patterns are tested before they are
generalized to other local nodes.

### Allowed behavior

- run the same core contracts as the VPS hub
- test candidate workflows and evaluation jobs
- exercise bounded autonomous loops
- publish validated candidate artifacts to the hub

### Forbidden default behavior

- bypassing broker contracts
- becoming an ad hoc second hub
- directly coordinating with other local nodes as a normal path

## 3. Engineering Node

The engineering node is optimized for build, debugging, and implementation
workloads.

It should specialize in:

- Hermes-backed engineering tasks
- local workspaces and repositories
- artifact generation for code and docs
- bounded replay of relevant continuity and task context

It should publish:

- execution summaries
- build artifacts and reports
- approved engineering knowledge
- benchmark and failure data relevant to the shared system

It should keep local:

- machine-specific workspaces
- transient build state
- local caches
- credentials and private execution details

### Allowed behavior

- consume shared continuity state from the hub
- publish outputs and artifacts back to the hub
- participate in evaluation runs relevant to engineering tasks

### Forbidden default behavior

- direct production mutation without promotion controls
- direct node-to-node coordination as a normal control path

## 4. Research / Experimental Node

The research node is the right home for aggressive autonomous experimentation.

This is where `autoresearch` fits best.

Why:

- it assumes repeated autonomous mutation
- it works well in constrained experimental loops
- it optimizes for exploration velocity over runtime stability
- it benefits from isolation from the live production path

In this architecture, the research node is the place for:

- broad prompt and strategy search
- benchmark-driven iteration
- experimental agent org structures
- `autoresearch`-style overnight loops
- high-churn candidate generation

### Allowed behavior

- autonomous mutation of experimental code and prompts
- local benchmark loops
- speculative search over strategy space
- generation of candidate artifacts, reports, and benchmark results

### Required outputs to the hub

- candidate artifacts
- experiment summaries
- benchmark metrics
- trace and lineage references
- optionally distilled findings or design recommendations

### Forbidden default behavior

- direct promotion into shared production behavior
- direct mutation of VPS hub configuration
- direct mutation of shared memory, workflow policy, or broker semantics

## Research Node and `autoresearch`

Karpathy's `autoresearch` is a strong fit for the research node because it is
fundamentally:

- a discovery engine
- a mutation-and-evaluate loop
- a research sandbox

It is not a good default fit for the VPS hub because the hub must remain:

- stable
- shared
- auditable
- rollback-friendly

So the architecture should treat `autoresearch` as:

- **first-class on the research node**
- **candidate-producing, not self-promoting**

That keeps the system ambitious without making the shared runtime reckless.

## Promotion Model Across Nodes

All nodes follow the same promotion rule:

1. generate candidate
2. evaluate candidate
3. publish candidate and metrics
4. review or policy-gate candidate
5. canary or staged rollout
6. adopt more broadly if it holds

This applies even to the research node. The difference is not whether it can
generate candidates; the difference is how aggressive its search space is.

## Node-to-Node Policy

Default system policy remains hub-and-spoke:

- node -> hub: normal
- hub -> node: normal
- node -> node: exceptional

This matters most for the research node. It may be noisy, but it should still
publish through the hub unless a later explicit exception is designed.

## Acceptance Criteria

The node-role model is ready when:

- each node type has a distinct optimization goal
- the research node has a clear place for `autoresearch`
- no node is implicitly allowed to self-promote into production
- publish, replay, and promotion responsibilities are clear
- local experimentation and shared runtime governance are clearly separated
