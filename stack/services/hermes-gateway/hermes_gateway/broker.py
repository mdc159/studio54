"""HTTP client that publishes lifecycle events to the broker.

The broker at http://127.0.0.1:8090 owns the durable event log. The
gateway has one job here: per Hermes run, publish a clean timeline of
``run.created`` -> ``run.started`` -> ``run.completed`` | ``run.failed``
so downstream nodes (Paperclip UI, Langfuse ingest in Phase G) can
stitch together what happened.

Design:

- Async (httpx.AsyncClient) — the gateway is FastAPI, so every call
  the app layer makes is already in an event loop.
- Idempotent everywhere. The broker itself short-circuits duplicates
  by primary key / idempotency_key, so we can safely replay events
  after a crash without poisoning the timeline.
- Stateless. The client doesn't cache anything; it just constructs
  the right JSON and fires it. Any per-run state the app needs lives
  on the SpawnHandle.

Idempotency key scheme:

    run.created    -> "{run_id}:created"
    run.started    -> "{run_id}:started"
    run.completed  -> "{run_id}:completed"
    run.failed     -> "{run_id}:failed"

This lets a crashed gateway restart and re-publish ``run.failed`` for
runs that never finished without creating duplicate terminal events.
